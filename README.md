# Random Quote Generator

This is part of the TechDegree program. The resulting program is the final project as part of Unit 01 where I was asked to build a random quote generator with a handful of requirements and some extra credit items.

### How it works

It accepts an array of quotes which the code then parses into a string of HTML and prints that to the page on load, click of a button, and at a set interval it will auto refresh for another random quote. In additional to changing the quote it also randomly sets a new background color as the style on the `body` tag.
